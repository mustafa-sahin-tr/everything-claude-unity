# /unity-build-android — Build for Android

Fixed-platform shortcut for `/unity-build Android`. Builds an installable Android package.

## Workflow

Use the `unity-build-runner` agent to:

### Step 1: Pre-Build Checks

1. **Check console** via `read_console` — abort if compilation errors exist.
2. **Check project info** via `project_info` resource — confirm current active platform and Unity version.
3. **Validate build scenes** — ensure every scene in the build list exists on disk.
4. Confirm no `#if UNITY_EDITOR`-unguarded `UnityEditor` usage snuck into runtime code.

### Step 2: Configure Android Platform

Via `manage_build`:
- Switch active platform to **Android** if not already active.
- Player settings: package name — the project has no Android `applicationIdentifier` configured yet, so ask the user for one (e.g. `com.<company>.<game>`, matching the iOS bundle id) the first time this command runs, rather than guessing.
- Minimum API level: 24+ unless the project already specifies otherwise.
- IL2CPP scripting backend, ARM64 only (disable ARMv7) for a modern device build.
- Output format: ask the user once — **APK** (for direct install/sideload on a test device) or **AAB** (for Play Store upload) — if not already clear from context. Default to APK for local device testing since that matches "open and run on my device" workflows.
- Keystore/signing: leave as configured. If unset and the user wants a signed release build, tell them to configure a keystore first rather than generating one automatically.

### Step 3: Build

```
manage_build action:"build" (target: Android) → trigger the build
read_console → monitor progress and catch errors
```

Output to the project's existing Android build output folder if one exists (check for a prior `Builds/Android` or similar path before creating a new one); otherwise use a sensible default and report the exact path chosen.

### Step 4: Report

- Build result: SUCCESS or FAILURE.
- Exact path to the built `.apk`/`.aab`.
- Build size.
- Any warnings from the build log.
- If failed: error details and suggested fixes (see table below).
- Explicit next step for the user: for an APK, `adb install -r <path>` with a device connected, or drag-and-drop onto an emulator; for an AAB, upload via Play Console.

## What NOT To Do

- Never modify `ProjectSettings/` files directly — use MCP (`manage_build`) only.
- Never generate or commit a keystore — that's the user's to manage.
- Never silently pick a package name — ask once, then reuse it on subsequent runs.
- Never skip the pre-build console check.

## Common Build Fixes

| Error | Fix |
|-------|-----|
| `UnityEditor` namespace | Add `#if UNITY_EDITOR` guard |
| Missing type/assembly | Check `.asmdef` references |
| Stripping removes code | Add entries to `link.xml` |
| Build too large | Run `/unity-optimize` or `analyze-build-size.sh` |
| Gradle build failed | Check Android SDK/NDK paths in Unity's External Tools preferences |
